## About the Project

Chronos-AI is an artificial intelligence system developed to assist in archaeological discoveries through the analysis of GPR (Ground Penetrating Radar) and LIDAR data. The system uses unsupervised learning techniques, especially the DBSCAN algorithm, along with computer vision to identify buried structures in a non-invasive manner.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

The notebooks are organized by language:
- `notebooks/en/`: Notebooks in English
- `notebooks/pt-br/`: Notebooks in Portuguese

The datasets are located in the `data/` folder and are shared between both versions.
